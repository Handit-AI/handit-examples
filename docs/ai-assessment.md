# Your AI Review by Handit.ai
**Service:** Data Transformation & Mapping Â· **Model:** gpt-4o-mini Â· **Date:** 2025-08-20  
We performed an **initial analysis** of the prompts/control logic in this repo and found **production-relevant risks**. We've prepared **candidate patches** to validate once handit is connected.

**Overall Risk:** ðŸ”¶ Medium (both prompts)

| Criterion                 | JSON to CSV Transformation | Document to Schema Mapping |
| ------------------------- | :------------------------: | :------------------------: |
| Context & Rationale (0â€“5) |             4              |             3              |
| Format / Output Contract  |             5              |             4              |
| Examples & Edge Cases     |             3              |             2              |
| Determinism & Guardrails  |             4              |             3              |

## ðŸš¨ Production impact (read this)

> Even at **modest scale**, these issues create **real money & incident risk**.

**If you process ~10,000 docs/month** and see just **2%** invalid/ambiguous outputs:

* **~200 bad docs/month** â†’ **67 ops hours** of exception handling (â‰ˆ20â€“40 min each)
  â†’ Increased operational costs and potential delays in data processing
* **Inaccurate data transformation** can lead to **misinformed business decisions**
  â†’ Impact on strategic planning and reporting accuracy
* A single **schema mapping error** can **disrupt data pipelines** for hours
  â†’ **SLO breach** + on-call fire drill during critical periods
* **Incorrectly formatted outputs** inside CSV fields lead to **silent consumer errors**
  â†’ Failures discovered **days later** in audit processes

> Bottom line: this is **not cosmetic**â€”it hits **data integrity and operational efficiency**.

## Candidate patches (validated post-connect)

> Not applied yet. After you connect handit, we validate on your runs and open a Fix PR in â‰¤24h.

**A) Enhanced Contextual Guidance**

* Improve context and rationale by embedding more detailed explanations and examples
* Implementation approach: Add inline comments and rationale for each step
* **Target:** **Increase alignment and reduce errors by 20%**

**B) Comprehensive Edge Case Handling**

* Introduce more examples and edge cases to cover diverse scenarios
* Implementation details: Use few-shot prompting with varied data samples
* **Target:** Reduce edge case failures by 30%

**C) Robust Guardrails and Validation**

* Strengthen determinism and guardrails by specifying stricter validation rules
* **Target:** Enhance output consistency and reliability

## Rollout (48â€“72h)

1. **15-min Fix Review** (on the call): confirm flows & permissions so handit starts fixing your AI
2. **T+24h:** we **open Fix PR #1** with the validated patch
3. **T+48â€“72h:** quick A/B on recent runs; confirm lift.
4. **Rollback:** revert or do not accept the PR

**Metrics we track:** Error rate reduction, processing time efficiency, data accuracy improvements

---

## How to proceed

* Book the 15-min call; we walk scopes & exact files we'll touch, then enable the App (My calendly is https://calendly.com/cristhian-handit/30min)
* Manual setup https://docs.handit.ai/
* We proceed to **Fix PR #1 within 24h** of enablement

## Reviewer checklist

* [ ] Confirm handit can open PRs via the GitHub App (or temporary permission)
* [ ] Select target flows (Data Transformation, Schema Mapping)
* [ ] Agree success metrics (Error rate, processing efficiency)
* [ ] Add a reviewer who owns downstream consumers of these fields
* [ ] **[Book the 15-min Fix Review](https://calendly.com/cristhian-handit/30min)** if not scheduled

## Notes from analysis (context)

* **JSON to CSV Transformation:** The prompt provides clear instructions and output format, but lacks comprehensive examples for edge cases.
* **Document to Schema Mapping:** The prompt effectively uses a schema contract but could benefit from more explicit context and rationale to guide the AI's reasoning.
