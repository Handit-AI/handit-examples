# Your AI Review by Handit.ai
**Service:** Data Transformation & Mapping Â· **Model:** gpt-4o-mini Â· **Date:** 2025-08-20  
We performed an **initial analysis** of the prompts/control logic in this repo and found **production-relevant risks**. We've prepared **candidate patches** to validate once handit is connected.

**Overall Risk:** ðŸ”¶ Medium (both prompts)

## ðŸš¨ Production impact (read this)

> Even at **modest scale**, these issues create **real money & incident risk**.

**If you process ~10,000 docs/month** and see just **2%** invalid/ambiguous outputs:

* **~200 bad docs/month** â†’ **67 ops hours** of exception handling (â‰ˆ20â€“40 min each)
  â†’ Increased operational costs and potential delays in data processing
* **Data quality issues** can lead to **misinformed business decisions**
  â†’ Impact on strategic planning and resource allocation
* A single **schema mapping failure** can **halt data pipelines** for hours
  â†’ **SLO breach** + on-call fire drill during critical periods
* **Incorrect data extraction** inside structured fields leads to **silent consumer errors**
  â†’ Failures discovered **days later** in audit processes

> Bottom line: this is **not cosmetic**â€”it hits **data integrity and operational efficiency**.

## Candidate patches (validated post-connect)

> Not applied yet. After you connect handit, we validate on your runs and open a Fix PR in â‰¤24h.

**A) Enhanced Edge Case Handling**

* Introduce more comprehensive examples and edge cases in prompts
* Implementation approach: Add few-shot examples to guide the model
* **Target:** Reduce ambiguous outputs by 30%

**B) Improved Contextual Instructions**

* Strengthen context and rationale sections to guide AI reasoning
* Implementation details: Expand on the rationale for each task
* **Target:** Increase alignment with desired outcomes by 20%

**C) Robust Testability Framework**

* Develop a testing framework to validate prompt outputs
* **Target:** Ensure consistent and reliable outputs across different scenarios

## Rollout (48â€“72h)

1. **15-min Fix Review** (on the call): confirm flows & permissions so handit starts fixing your AI
2. **T+24h:** we **open Fix PR #1** with the validated patch
3. **T+48â€“72h:** quick A/B on recent runs; confirm lift.
4. **Rollback:** revert or do not accept the PR

**Metrics we track:** Output accuracy, error rate reduction, processing efficiency

---

## How to proceed

* Book the 15-min call; we walk scopes & exact files we'll touch, then enable the App (My calendly is https://calendly.com/cristhian-handit/30min)
* Manual setup https://docs.handit.ai/
* We proceed to **Fix PR #1 within 24h** of enablement

## Reviewer checklist

* [ ] Confirm handit can open PRs via the GitHub App (or temporary permission)
* [ ] Select target flows (Data Transformation, Schema Mapping)
* [ ] Agree success metrics (Output accuracy, error rate)
* [ ] Add a reviewer who owns downstream consumers of these fields
* [ ] **[Book the 15-min Fix Review](https://calendly.com/cristhian-handit/30min)** if not scheduled

---

## Notes from analysis (context)

* **Data Shaping Assistant:** The prompt provides clear instructions and a structured output format, but lacks comprehensive examples for edge cases.
* **Multimodal Mapping System:** Strong emphasis on schema adherence and visual cues, yet could benefit from more detailed examples and rationale.
