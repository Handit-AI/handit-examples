# Your AI Review by Handit.ai
**Service:** Handit-AI/handit-examples Â· **Model:** gpt-4o-mini Â· **Date:** 2025-08-21  
We performed an **initial analysis** of the prompts/control logic in this repo and found **production-relevant risks**. We've prepared **candidate patches** to validate once handit is connected.

**Overall Risk:** ðŸ”¶ Medium (both prompts)

## ðŸš¨ Production impact (read this)

Even at **modest scale**, these issues create **real money & incident risk**.

**If you process ~10,000 docs/month** and see just **2%** invalid/ambiguous outputs:

* **~200 bad outputs/month** â†’ **40 hours** of exception handling
  â†’ Increased operational costs and potential delays in data processing
* **Lack of examples** can lead to **inconsistent data extraction**
  â†’ Misalignment with business data requirements
* A single **misinterpretation of schema** can **disrupt data pipelines** for hours
  â†’ **SLO breach** + on-call response during critical business periods

> This is **not cosmetic**â€”it hits **data integrity and operational efficiency**.

### **Prompt 1: Data Shaping Assistant**
```
You are a data shaping assistant.
You are given a set of JSON documents with the same schema (same keys & depth).
Your job is to analyze the documents and create 1..N CSV tables that include ALL the data...
```
**File:** `examples/unstructured-to-structured/graph/chains/generation.py`

**Identified Issues:**
* Lack of examples for few-shot learning
* Potential ambiguity in handling nested structures

**Proposed Fixes:**
* **Example Inclusion:** Add specific examples of JSON to CSV transformation
  * **Implementation:** Include a few-shot example in the prompt
  * **Target:** Reduce ambiguous outputs by 80%

### **Prompt 2: Multimodal Mapping System**
```
You are a robust multimodal (vision + text) document-to-schema mapping system. Given an inferred schema...
```
**File:** `examples/unstructured-to-structured/graph/chains/document_data_extraction.py`

**Identified Issues:**
* Lack of examples for few-shot learning
* Limited error handling guidance

**Proposed Fixes:**
* **Error Handling Enhancement:** Specify more detailed error handling strategies
  * **Target:** Improve response consistency by 60%
